Let's add a front end to this app using bootstrap. I want the site to look similar to Google on the index page, having a rounded search bar in the middle of the page with a somewhat transparent magnifying glass icon on the right side. The user types their query and hits enter, then is taken to a results page that displays the result of the database query in table format.

In the center of the navbar display the site name 'Football Sage', which the user can click to come back to the index page. In the top-right of the navbar have links for 'docs', 'github' (using the github icon), 'twitter' (using the twitter icon).

For styling, I want rounded edges and soft neutral colors. If there is a pre-made bootstrap theme that satisfies these constraints, use that. If not, write the styling yourself.
